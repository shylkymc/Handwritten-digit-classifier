# Handwritten Digit Classifier
A study on a hand written digit data set. 

## Introduction
We have used a data set which is obtained from Scikit-learn. We used classification methods to identify digits. After that we have explored our classification model's success.

## Introduction
We have used Paython 3.7 on Jupyter Notebook. We have practiced on some  below:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
