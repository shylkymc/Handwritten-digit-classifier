# Handwritten Digit Classifier

I created a model to classify handwritten digits. I used a data set which is obtained from Scikit-Learn. Scikit-learn copies the data set from UCI. I explored the data set by using Pandas and Matplotlib. I did not make any changes on the data because the data set is clean and ready for implementation. 
I have started to set my models to find the best fit. I have created functions which gather the data set and then train and test the model on it. I have used knn classification, neural networks and random forests.  I have tested my models by calculating their accuracies. For this purpose, I have created cross validation function to test my models by getting accuracies.

## Conclusion

With 4-fold cross validation function, I have gotten approximately 96% accuracy for my knn classification model.

The accuracy has started with 86% for neural networks. I have used different hidden layers and neurons to see accuracies. I have obtained 95% accuracy with two hidden layers. And I have gotten 96% accuracy with three hidden layers. When I have used more hidden layers and more neurons, my accuracy has been higher. 

Lastly, I have used random forests, and my highest accuracy is approximately 94%.

As a conclusion, I can say that I have gotten the highest accuracy score with nueral networks with three hidden layers.
